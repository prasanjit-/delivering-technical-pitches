<div class="section" id="research">
<h2>Research<a class="headerlink" href="#research" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Start with the company priorities - especially when engaging with senior leadership - the higher you go the more important it gets. The ability to read the financials of an organization’s published material from the investor relations website, quarterly business updates are all great sources to give you an idea of where the company is heading, what its key priorities are, and how you could align with it when positioning your great idea.</p>
<p>A top tip on this is - senior executives are very consistent and aligned with their leadership and with their peers too - and hence instead of second-guessing what matters most to them as an organization - start with the published material and then engage with them in a way to demonstrate how you can help them deliver.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="industry-trends">
<h2>Industry Trends<a class="headerlink" href="#industry-trends" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>These are usually market-making opportunities or a heads up on an upcoming threat - Executives spend a lot of time staying on top of it - after all, they are responsible for steering their organizations through both the good and bad times and create value in the process. These are great bits of information that can be leveraged to make a case for what you are trying to position.</p>
<p>A good source for these apart from the usual journals is insights published by the big four consulting companies. They are usually organized by industries and while the public version might be light on details, they provide a good overview to get you the drift</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="has-this-been-done-by-your-company-before">
<h2>Has this been done by your company before?<a class="headerlink" href="#has-this-been-done-by-your-company-before" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One of the starks learnings, working at one of the big fours was - being paid the consultant money not alone, for what I was able to come up with. My real value as someone representing the organization was additionally down to my ability to bring the collective knowledge of the organizations to bear. After all - when someone says they have hired a 20yr old organization to help out - that wisdom should show even if you have been in the org. only for a few years.</p>
<p>Reach out to your network, internal groups, focus teams - ask around if there has been something similar done. More often than ever you are likely to find something close, or sometimes even better a slightly different perspective which could open up a new dimension on addressing what you were originally intending to cover.</p>
<p>Leverage the collective wisdom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="know-your-audience">
<h2>Know your audience<a class="headerlink" href="#know-your-audience" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Research isn’t just limited to the organizations context, but also to the audience - their bosses and including their influencers. How do they like their message to be delivered - do they prefer stats, pictures, storyline, detailed or brief. Adjusting your narrative accordingly will make for an engaging conversation.</p>
<p>Google can be your friend in this scenario - look your audience up for public presentations and appearances. Youtube is usually a great source for these especially when you are engaging very senior industry executives. I find some amount of comfort in watching someone speak in a video ahead of meeting them for the first time. I am not quite sure how it helps, but it certainly makes things familiar and helps with the nerves.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="align-on-the-agenda">
<h2>Align on the agenda<a class="headerlink" href="#align-on-the-agenda" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Yes, this sounds obvious - but it is almost always helpful to speak to an internal coach or a supporter in the customer’s organization to run them past the agenda. Priorities change often, sometimes due to a last-minute internal meeting and while you might be preparing based on what was discussed a week back, it might no longer be relevant. Additionally the insights on the current needs you get through these conversations - help you to contextualize what you are going to be covering.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="align-with-your-internal-stakeholders">
<h2>Align with your internal stakeholders<a class="headerlink" href="#align-with-your-internal-stakeholders" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>More often than ever, you attend these senior executive meetings with your wider organization - Typically these would be your sales counterparts, perhaps your leadership as well. The idea of having a wider team is to enrich the conversation by having them build upon your idea from their point of view.</p>
<p>Share your line of thought early on, and then share your presentation and narrative as well - this gives everyone some time to put together their thoughts around supporting your ideas to drive to the shared collective outcome.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="share-the-presentation-as-a-pre-read">
<h2>Share the presentation as a pre-read<a class="headerlink" href="#share-the-presentation-as-a-pre-read" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Nothing is worse than doing all this work and realizing, on the day, that the audience expected a different perspective or need more details or preferred a higher level overview and what you had was too detailed. Unless there is something on an unveiling of an idea that is best left to last minute (like a product, feature launches, sales offers - things you want to use to grab attention), it’s always worth sharing your deck in advance.</p>
<p>In addition to the alignment - it also helps reduce the amount of effort you need to spend to convey the idea as it’s generally something most people would skim through ahead of the presentation.</p>
<p>Having said that - it is safe to assume that there is always a probability that your audience didn’t get the opportunity to go through your presentation and might end up surprising you - which is what brings us to the next part - how to prepare your content.</p>
