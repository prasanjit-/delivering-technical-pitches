*"Imagine a big explosion as you climb through 3,000 ft. Imagine a plane full of smoke. Imagine an engine going clack, clack, clack. It sounds scary. Well, I had a unique seat that day. I was sitting in 1D."*

That was Ric Elias talking about his survival at the 'Miracle on the Hudson'! Didn't that paint a picture in your mind? Visual depiction of discussed matters during a presentation, meeting, strategic session, brainstorm and training is always engaging. Some of you might be already wondering, when it comes to a technical pitch or a serious discussion with a customer, say, about optimizing cloud costs, how do we make that engaging? Hold that thought, I will come to this in a while. The point I want to make here that capturing the audience's attention is a very important aspect of any pitch. The more we engage the audience, the more effective the outcome will be.

Now, how do we engage the audience? Actually, we can chart the course of the conversation and plan on making it engaging!

  "A talk is a voyage. It must be charted. The speaker who starts nowhere usually gets there."
  
  *Dale Carnegie, American writer and lecturer, and the developer of courses in salesmanship. (1983)*

Here are a few of the ways, some of them from time-honored wisdom, others from personal experience and science!


On your marks!
***************
As we have seen in the previous chapter, having an effective start is very important for your pitch to go all the way into your audience's imagination. Engagement begins right from the first word you utter and one of the surest ways is by the visual story-telling approach we discussed a while ago, talking about an anecdote that relates to the theme or something that forces the audiences mind to draw pictures! 

Another way is to start with questions or statistics. And following up with a couple of more questions that compel the listener to think and appreciate the problem and then you start with discussing the answers. This technique is also called the question and hammer technique. Asking questions also helps set the expectations. It helps in digging into the 'why' of problems that our pitch promises to solve. And that brings us to another technique going back to 2400 years! - the Aristotelian `triptych <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triptych>`_
