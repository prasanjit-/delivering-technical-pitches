   :alt: Delivering Technical Pitches

I have worked now in software engineering for about `two decades  <https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajatpandit/>`_. During my time, often I would come across ideas that could be game-changing for the business or a new approach. Doing anything significant required buy-in from a wider set of stakeholders. I have had a fair share of success and failures to make them happen.

In my current role in the cloud pre-sales, part of the job is to present a technical point of view. These differ based on the audience - their areas of concern and focus. Over the years I have come across some brilliant presentations and some not too good ones. I often wondered if there was some value in curating these patterns.

This eBook is an attempt to capture those ideas and share them with pre-sales, consultants. The hope is that it will help the readers build confidence. Help them sharpen their narrative as they prepare for the next big pitch.
